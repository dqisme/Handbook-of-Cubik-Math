# Chapter 2-1: Cubies and Cubicles

Looking at the cube as a whole, at first glance, it appears to be made up of 3x3x3=27 cubies in three layers, each layer being a three-by-three square of small cubies. However, it is only possible to see the outside of the cube, so that only 26 cubies can be seen. The one in the center is only imaginary. Also, all that we can see of each of the 26 visible cubies are the colored facelets which combine to form the six faces of the entire cube. Each face of the cube is made up of nine such facelets. Thus there are 6x9=54 facelets ont the cube.

Terminology | Definition or Abbreviation
------------|---------------------------
Cubies | The small cube pieces which make up the whole cube.
Cubicles | The spaces occupied by cubies.
Facelets | The faces of a cubie.
Types of Cubies:<br> Corner, Edge, and Center | A corner cubie has three facelets.<br> An edge cubie has two facelets.<br> A center cubie has one facelet.
Home Location -- of a cubie | The cubicle to which a cubie should be restored.
Home Position -- of a cubie | The orientation in the home location to which a cubie should be restored.
Positional Names for Cube Faces | Up/Down/Right/Left/Front/Back
Notation for Cubicles -- shown in *italics* | Lower case initials. For example, *uf* denotes the Up-Front edge cubicle.
Notation for Cubies -- shown in *italics* | Upper case initials. For example, *URF* denotes the cubie whose home position is in the Up-Right-Front corner.
Notation for Face Turns -- shown in **BLOCK** CAPITAL LETTERS | The initials, U, F, R, D, B, and L denote clockwise quarter turns. U<sup>-1</sup>, F<sup>-1</sup>, R<sup>-1</sup>, D<sup>-1</sup>, B<sup>-1</sup>, and L<sup>-1</sup> denote counter-clockwise quarter turns. U<sup>2</sup>, F<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, D<sup>2</sup>, B<sup>2</sup>, and L<sup>2</sup> denote half turns.
Moving the Whole Cube | ùì§, ùìï, ùì°, ùìì, ùìë and ùìõ denote clockwise turns of the whole cube behind the indicated face.
