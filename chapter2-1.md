# Chapter 2-1: Cubies and Cubicles

Looking at the cube as a whole, at first glance, it appears to be made up of 3x3x3=27 cubies in three layers, each layer being a three-by-three square of small cubies. However, it is only possible to see the outside of the cube, so that only 26 cubies can be seen. The one in the center is only imaginary. Also, all that we can see of each of the 26 visible cubies are the colored facelets which combine to form the six faces of the entire cube. Each face of the cube is made up of nine such facelets. Thus there are 6x9=54 facelets on the cube.

Positional Names for Cube Faces | Up/Down/Right/Left/Front/Back
Notation for Cubicles -- shown in *italics* | Lower case initials. For example, *uf* denotes the Up-Front edge cubicle.
Notation for Cubies -- shown in *italics* | Upper case initials. For example, *URF* denotes the cubie whose home position is in the Up-Right-Front corner.
Notation for Face Turns -- shown in BLOCK CAPITAL LETTERS | The initials, U, F, R, D, B, and L denote clockwise quarter turns. U<sup>-1</sup>, F<sup>-1</sup>, R<sup>-1</sup>, D<sup>-1</sup>, B<sup>-1</sup>, and L<sup>-1</sup> denote counter-clockwise quarter turns. U<sup>2</sup>, F<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, D<sup>2</sup>, B<sup>2</sup>, and L<sup>2</sup> denote half turns.

Look now at the cubies which make up the cube. Notice that the cube has three types of cubies. Some cubies have three visible facelets as indicated in Figure 2-2. These are called *corner pieces*. There are eight corners of the cube. Other cubies have only two visible facelets as indicated in Figure 2-3. These cubies fill in the space along an edge between two corner pieces. Therefore, they are called *edge pieces*. There are twelve edge pieces, one on each of the twelve edges of the cube. The third type of cubie has only one visible facelet. This facelet, as shown in Figure 2-4 is in middle of a face. Thus these cubies are called *center pieces*. There are six center pieces corresponding to the six faces of the cube.

By rotating different faces of the cube, the cubies can be moved about. Each cubie moves to the location vacated by another cubie. These locations are called cubcles. The locations occupied by corner cubies are corner cubicles and the locations occupies by edge cubies are edge cubicles. Observe that no matter how faces are rotated, the corner pieces always move from one corner cubicle to another corner cubicle and the edge pieces always move from one edge cubicle to another edge cubicle. Rotating a face never moves a center cubie from one face to another. The center pieces have a fixed location relative to the other center pieces. They can only be spun in place. This is a particularly important observation, because it shows the following:

> The color of the center piece of any face defines the only color to which that face of the cube can be restored.

For each center piece the color of the opposite center piece never changes. Furthermore, if two opposite center pieces are placed in the positions of north and south poles respectively, then the sequential order of the other four center pieces around the equator is always the same.
