# Acknowledgments

The works of many people over the last decade have contributed to this book. Not only did Ern√∂ Rubik devise the Magic Cube, but he also has contributed substantially to an understanding of the possible movements of cube pieces. Both John Conway and Tamas Varga are among the early pioneers in the study of cubik math, and to these and many others like them, the authors are particularly indebted.

Much of the material in this book is derived from David Singmaster's Notes on Rubik's Magic Cube. Related to this, there have been literally thousands of letters from many correspondents over the last several years that have contributed to both books.To facilitate the further exchange of new ideas, there is now a cubik circular.Persons may write to D.S. Ltd., 66 Mount View Rd., London N4 4JR, United kingdom for particulars.Interesting mathematical puzzles will also be distributed by this company.

The first U.S. importer of the Magic Cube was Logical Games Inc., Haymarket, Virginia. We are most grateful to its founder, Bela Szalai, whose idea for this book brought the authors together.

Many people have contributed to the preparation of the book. Lowell Smith and Alice H. Frey both read the entire manuscript, eliminating many errors. Cathy Schrott of Jantron Inc. did an outstanding job of page layout and typesetting. Special appreciation is extended to Helen Koehler Frey who not only read the entire manuscript several times, but also supplied the patient encouragement needed to finally complete this project.
